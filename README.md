# DS202-Final-Project

This is our final project for DS202 at Iowa State University.

In this analysis, we explore a dataset detailing information about how covid had an impact on people's work lives.

We answer the follwing questions:

1 What cleaning methods were applied, and why?
2 What is the distribution of the Productivity_Change Variable? 
3 What is the impact of working from home on productivity change?
-   Stress Level & Working from Home
-   Sector
-   Sector & Working from Home
-   Childcare Responsibilities & Working from Home
-   Health Issues & Working from Home
4 Are there significant correlations between productivity_change and other numeric variables? 
5 Do employees who experienced salary cuts show different productivity trends compared to those with stable salaries?
6 What was the impact of Childcare Responsibilities, Commuting Changes, and Health Issues on Technology Adaptation Levels
7 What are the key takeaways or recommendations based on our analysis?
8 What can we improve if this analysis were conducted again?
