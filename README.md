# DS202-Final-Project

This is our final project for DS202 at Iowa State University.

In this analysis, we explore a dataset detailing information about how covid had an impact on people's work lives.

We answer the follwing questions:

- What is the distribution of the Productivity_Change Variable? 
- What is the impact of working from home on productivity change?
- Are there significant correlations between productivity_change and other numeric variables? 
- What cleaning methods were applied, and why?
- Can we identify any trends in productivity change over time (if the dataset has a time variable)? 
- What are the key takeaways or recommendations based on your analysis?
- What can we improve if this analysis were conducted again?
